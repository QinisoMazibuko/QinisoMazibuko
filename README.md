# Hey, I'm Q 👋

I write backend and platform stuff.  
Primarily Cloud (GCP, AWS, AZURE), Kubernetes, Terraform, and any other tools that get the job done.

I’m currently:
- building **Arbita.ai**, a legal-tech AI project for SA firms  
- working on **AI-powered developer tools** (Terraform agents, code reviewers, automation)  
- experimenting with generative models, and local-first dev environments

What I enjoy:
- clean infra design  
- making complex systems behave  
- automating anything repetitive  
- learning how AI can make engineering smoother

Things I’m usually working with:
`AWS`,· `AZURE`,· `GCP`, · `EKS` · `Terraform` · `ArgoCD` · `GitHub Actions`  
`Python` · `TypeScript` · `C#` · `Next.js`  
`AI/LLM toolchains`  

I don't update this profile often — but feel free to look around.
